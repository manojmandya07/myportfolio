# Cloud services

## Overview
Earlier, businesses and organizations bought, built, and maintained their own infrastructure and equipment for their IT requirements. Before, Businesses, IT Organizations maintained equipment like servers, storage drivers, cables, electrical infrastructure for data storage, etc., for their operation. But IT equipment is not cheap and gets outdated very quickly. Organizations hired an entire team to maintain this infrastructure.
Creating and maintaining your own IT or organization infrastructure can be:
* Expensive
* Unreliable
* Time Consuming

### What is a Cloud service?
Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. Cloud service providers maintain equipment, server/storage warehouses, and database on behalf of organizations. These providers charge users a nominal fee to use their services.

### Cloud Service Models
The Cloud Service Models are as follows:
* IAAS - Infrastructure as a Service
* PAAS - Platform as a Service
* SAAS - Software as a Service

### Infrastructure as a Service
- Offers computing capabilities on-demand over the web.
- Helps users to avoid the cost and complexity of maintainingservers.
- Resources offered include – storage facilities, networks, processing power, and virtual privateservers.
- Services are highlyscalable.
- Dynamic andflexible.
Examples – Google Clod Computing (GCP), AWS, Microsoft Azure, Cisco Metacloud, etc.

### Platform as a Service
- Offers access to a based environment where users can develop, test, run and manage theirapplications.
- Supports multiple languages andframeworks.
- Users can customize the features they want in theirsubscription.
- Users access the PaaS through a graphical user interface (GUI), where development or DevOps teams can collaborate on all theirwork.
Examples – Google App Engine, IBM cloud, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, etc

### Software as a Service
- SaaS is cloud-hosted, ready-to-use applicationsoftware.
- SaaS is also known as "on-demand software".
- Users can access these applications with the help of an internet connection and web browser.
- The application and all the infrastructure required are hosted andmanagedby the SaaS vendor.
- The vendor manages all upgrades and patches to thesoftware.
- Anyone who uses a mobile phone almost certainly uses some form of SaaS like Email, social media, and cloud file storagesolutions.
Examples – Google Workspace, Microsoft Office 365, Hubspot, Canva, Cisco WebEx, etc

## Advantages of Cloud services

- The main advantage of any Cloud service is low cost andmaintenance.
- High-level security through advanced security and protection provided by the cloudplatform.
- Complete and faster access to the latesttechnologies.
- Affordable infrastructure forstartups.
- Faster software testing anddevelopment.
- Provides simplified collaboration for shared software development and is highlyscalable.

## Disadvantages of Cloudservices
- Risk of dataconfidentiality.
- Depends on the internet connection.
- Technology vulnerabilities, especially in sharedenvironments.
- Cloud downtime.
- Limited control.
- Disadvantages and risks of Cloud services.

## Futurescope
- Over the years, cloud computing has accelerated at a very fast speed with the increasing reliance of big corporations on thistechnology.
- More and more organizations are adopting cloud platforms for their requirements. This enables more schools and colleges to use the perks of cloudservices.
- Emerging modular software development aids usage of cloudservices.
- With the widespread use of cloud computing in the contemporary digital environment, the trend of cloud computing is about to spread likewildfire.

## Conclusion
Cloud service is enabling on-demand services as opposed to traditional versions of server infrastructure. Cloud service is about to get bigger and better in terms of its use and popularity. As a new technological development that has the potential to have a great impact on the world. But
there are other challenges cloud services must overcome. People are concerned about data security and privacy as there are no standards or regulations worldwide for this. But once, there are standards and regulations worldwide, cloud computing will revolutionize the future.
